I came across DragonRuby when I bought itch.io's incredible [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality),
which ended up containing thousands of games, tools and resources for next to no money.

Buried in the 50+ pages of goodies was DragonRuby, a game toolkit that had previous passed me by. 
Using (obviously) the Ruby language, it aims to offer a small, fast and cross-platform toolkit by
handling all the messy rendering stuff and letting you focus on your coding.

It's important to understand that this is *not* trying to be a whole environment (a la GameMaker)
but rather giving you a window for your game, a bundle of primitives for drawing and getting input
from your user and generally staying the heck out of your way.

It's a programmers toolkit, not a designers one.

That said, Ruby is an elegant language (except in my hands) so even if you've never encountered it,
as long as you have a smattering of code in your blood you'll be fine.

About Me
--------

I've been coding for longer than I care to add up (to give you a clue, at University we were taught
this new language called C++ that was *so* new it didn't even have a compiler yet), in all manner of
lanuages. 

Professionally, it's been mostly C, PHP and a bit of scripting for good measure but in my spare time
I mess about with anything that catches my eye. I did briefly flirt with Ruby (more specifically,
Ruby On Rails) in very early days when it was a bit of a headache trying to get it deployed reliably
in a production environment. 

As such, I haven't really looked at Ruby for a decade and I'm (sort of) loving the chance to get under
the skin of yet another language. That means that any code of mine you look at is almost certainly
not idiomatic Ruby. It's probably doing it wrong. But it should work.

In other words, please feel free to read it, use it for inspiration but don't take it as The Right Way,
especially if someone who actually knows Ruby says otherwise :-)
